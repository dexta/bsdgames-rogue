# Test dates from Astronomical Almanac 1998, rounded to nearest hour.
# Should add dates from other years.

# We should also test the fraction illuminated given by the program, but
# it isn't really accurate enough to do this reliably and the Astronomical
# Almanac only gives these figures to 2 decimal places (like pom) so I don't
# know which are border cases and which are good tests.
