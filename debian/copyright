This package was originally debianized by Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>
in March 1997, and subsequently maintained (in succession) by Javier
Fernandez-Sanguino Peña <jfs@computer.org> and Aaron M. Ucko
<ucko@debian.org>.  Due to the license restrictions described below,
it is formally part of Debian's non-free category rather than Debian
proper ("main").

It was downloaded from ftp://ibiblio.org:/pub/Linux/games/ .

Primary upstream authors: Timothy Stoehr, Michael C. Toy, Ken Arnold,
and Glenn Wichman.
