Description: collection of text games from BSD systems - nonfree
 This is a collection of some of the text-based games that are common on 
 BSD systems. The games in this package may not be distributed freely, so
 they had to be broken off from the main bsdgames package and placed in
 non-free.
 .
 Includes only the 'rogue' game.
