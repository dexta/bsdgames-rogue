bsdgames-nonfree (2.17-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * rogue/move.c (check_hunger): Achieve every-other-move effects correctly,
    by consulting m_moves rather than rogue.moves_left.  (Closes: #726195.)

bsdgames-nonfree (2.17-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * rogue/init.c: Give the initial bow a damage value of 1d1 for
    consistency with object.c; 1d2 was presumably a typo.
  * rogue/{object.c,rogue.h,save.c}: factor an assign_damage function out
    of gr_weapon, and call it from read_pack because saved values (raw
    pointers to string constants) may be invalid.  (The setup was always
    fragile, and broke altogether when 2.17-4 made the executable
    position-independent and subject to loading at randomized addresses.)
    (Closes: #695262.)

bsdgames-nonfree (2.17-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * config.params: defer to debian/rules for build flags (which weren't
    set quite as intended in noopt mode anyway, per a longstanding typo).
  * debian/compat: Advance to Debhelper 9.
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 9), implying a new enough dpkg-dev.
    - Depends: ${misc:Depends}, which debhelper could theoretically populate.
    - Vcs-*: point to (new) personal repository on anonscm.debian.org.
    - Retire conflict against ancient (pre-split) bsdgames.
    - Standards-Version: 3.9.3 (now compliant).
  * debian/copyright: clean up and convert to DEP5 format 1.0.
  * debian/rules:
    - Minimize further by switching to override_dh_* style.
    - Pass in dpkg's recommended flags, including full hardening flags.
  * (debian/).gitignore: ignore generated files.

    - Support "noopt" in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    - debian/tmp -> debian/bsdgames-nonfree.

bsdgames-nonfree (2.14-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version:
      - fixes buffer overflow in rogue (priviledge escalation to
      'games' since it's setgid)
      - removes hack (Closes: #188279) 
  * Note: I'm hurrying this upload due to the security fix for rogue
  (see SECURITY). However, with the security fix changes 'rogue' will
  no longer save on empty files. Also, there is no transition done from
  previous hack save files (which should now be handled by 'bsdgames'
  which now provides 'hack')

    GNUMakefile being called instead)
  * Fixed the debian/rules since it was cleaning files in
    /var/games/bsdgames-nonfree/hack that were not zero-byte (and might be
    used by the game)

bsdgames-nonfree (2.1-3) frozen unstable; urgency=medium
