bsdgames-nonfree (2.14-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version:
      - fixes buffer overflow in rogue (priviledge escalation to
      'games' since it's setgid)
      - removes hack (Closes: #188279) 
  * Note: I'm hurrying this upload due to the security fix for rogue
  (see SECURITY). However, with the security fix changes 'rogue' will
  no longer save on empty files. Also, there is no transition done from
  previous hack save files (which should now be handled by 'bsdgames'
  which now provides 'hack')

    /var/games/bsdgames-nonfree/hack that were not zero-byte (and might be
    used by the game)
